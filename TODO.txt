Key Generation:

- Creates an RSA key pair (public/private keys)
- Generates random AES keys for each password

Encryption Process:

- Each password gets its own AES key (for better security)
- The password is encrypted using AES-256 (fast and secure)
- The AES key is then encrypted using RSA (this is called key wrapping)
- Everything is packaged together in a single payload

Decryption Process:

- The RSA private key decrypts the AES key
- The decrypted AES key is then used to decrypt the password
- Padding is removed to get the original password

The advantages of this hybrid approach are:

- RSA is used only for encrypting the small AES key
- AES handles the actual password encryption (much faster than RSA)
- Each password gets its own AES key (if one is compromised, others stay safe)
- The code includes proper padding and IV handling for security

Important security to add:
- Error handling, secure memory wiping, and key storage protection
- The RSA private key needs to be stored securely (possibly protected by a master password)
- Consider adding salt and key derivation functions for the master password
- Add integrity checks (like HMAC) to detect tampering
