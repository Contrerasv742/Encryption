# Algorithms
Currently being designed in the backend. Eventually, will be usable in the GUI once most 
the alogirthms are correctly implemented and password managing is completed.

# Purpose
Intended to create a password manager with RSA Encryption to properly store my personal 
passwords locally. Project will also aid in understanding core encryption algorithms. 
Additionally, I will learn about making cross platform applications.

# Tools
```bash
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qtbase6-dev-tools
```
# Compilation
```bash
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```

# Execution
```bash
    ./encryption
```

# Dates
Start: July 2024
End: TBD
